Artificial Intelligence
    Machine Learning:
        Process:
        Loading data
        Preprocessing
        Training a model
        Evaluating the model
        making predictions  
        Type:
        1,  supervised machine Learning  -- Learns from labeled data
                Regression  -- continuous (resale price of home)
                Classification  -- categorical
        2,  unsupervised machine learning
        3,  reinforcement machine learning

        Deep Learning:

            Type:
                1, Image and videos
                2, 

               
                
            Models:
                Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)
                Convolution Neural Network (CNN)  -- Detect patterns in (visual data)images
                Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  -- design to handle sequence data(struggle to handle long sequence data)
                Type:
                   One-to-one
                   One-to-many
                   Many-to-one
                   Many-to-many
                Variational Autoencoders
                Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
                Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  - widely use for image generation task
                Transformers  - text based modes

            Generative AI:
                Type:
                    Image based
                    Text based
                Large Language Models:
                    Lifecycle:
                        pretraining(unsupervised) > fine tuning(supervised) > prompt Engineering > Evaluation and iteration > Deployment and maintenance
